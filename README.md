An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without a human pilot on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS); which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two. The UAVâ€™s can be controlled either by ground station or they can fly autonomously with autopilot. Here we have designed a fixed wing UAV. A fixed-wing aircraft is a flying machine, which is capable of flight by using its wings that will generate lift by creating a pressure difference over it due to its shape. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft (in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft or "mast") like quadcopters, and ornithopters (in which the wings flap in a manner similar to that of a bird). UAVs have various applications in military as well as in civilian life. In military, UAVs are used for surveillance operations, payload drop operations, etc. In civilian, UAVs can be used for drone delivery project, data collection, photography etc
